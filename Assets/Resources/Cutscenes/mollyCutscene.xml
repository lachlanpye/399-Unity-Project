    <line speaker="molly">God he's annoying, isn't he?</line>
    <line speaker="father">...Who?</line>
    <line speaker="molly">Lucas.</line>
    <line speaker="molly">You know, your son?</line>
    <line speaker="father">I-I don't - </line>
    <line speaker="molly">He just never knows when to leave me alone!</line>
    <line speaker="molly">I'm trying to watch some goddamn television and he's just standing at the bottom of the stairs crying!</line>
    <line speaker="father">Molly, what are you talking about - </line>
    <line speaker="molly">Let me finish!</line>
    <line speaker="molly">And I know he wants to say something to me, so I turn around and say "What do you want?"</line>
    <line speaker="molly">And he says "I miss my mom."</line>
    <line speaker="molly">And I look back at the TV, and I realize that while he was snivelling...</line>
    <line speaker="molly">I'd missed who got sent home from American Idol!</line>
    <line speaker="molly">So I turn back to the snot nosed kid and say, "Well, what the fuck do you want me to do about it?"</line>
    <line speaker="molly">And then he just runs upstairs again! I mean, why did he come down in the first place?!</line>
    <line speaker="father">...</line>
    <line speaker="molly">I thought you raised him better than that, Ray.</line>
    <line speaker="molly">Oh, that's right.</line>
    <line speaker="molly">You didn't raise him.</line>
