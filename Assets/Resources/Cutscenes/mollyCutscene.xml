    <line speaker="molly">God he's annoying, isn't he?</line>
    <line speaker="father">...Who?</line>
    <line speaker="molly">Lucas.</line>
    <line speaker="molly">You know, your son?</line>
    <line speaker="father">I-I don't - </line>
    <line speaker="molly">He just never knows when to leave me alone!</line>
    <line speaker="molly">I'm trying to watch some goddamn television...</line>
    <line speaker="molly">...and he's just standing at the bottom of the stairs crying!</line>
    <line speaker="father">Molly, what are you talking about- </line>
    <line speaker="molly">Let me finish!</line>
    <line speaker="molly">I know he wants me to say something to him...</line>
    <line speaker="molly">...so I turn around and say “What do you want?”</line>
    <line speaker="molly">Then he says “I miss my Mum”.</line>
    <line speaker="molly">When I look back at the TV I realised that while he was snivelling away...</line>
    <line speaker="molly">I'd missed who got sent home from American Idol!</line>
    <line speaker="molly">So I turn back to the snot-nosed brat and say,</line>
    <line speaker="molly">“Well, what the fuck do you want me to do about it?"</line>
    <line speaker="molly">Then he just runs back upstairs again.</line>
    <line speaker="molly">I mean, why did he even come down in the first place?!</line>
    <line speaker="father">...</line>
    <line speaker="molly">I thought you raised him better than that, Raymond.</line>
    <line speaker="molly">Oh, that's right...</line>
    <line speaker="molly">You didn't raise him.</line>
